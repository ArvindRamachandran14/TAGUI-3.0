# TAGUI-3.0

This is the latest graphical user interface program developed to visualize and record data from the ThermoAnalyzer(TA)

To run download this repository and run the TAGUI.py program and you should be able to see the GUI developed for this project

The TA is an apparatus that is used to study the thermodynamics of Direct Air Capture sorbents. Direct Air Capture (DAC) is the process of capturing CO2 from the atmosphere, as a way of managing the build up of CO2 in the atomsphere. To learm more about DAC visit https://cnce.engineering.asu.edu/

The TA is controlled by the thermodynamic analyzer controller (TAC), which in our set up is a program running on a Raspberry Pi 3 computer. 
The software for the TAC can be found at https://github.com/ArvindRamachandran14/TAC-2.0
